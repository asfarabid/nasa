## How to Test

### Test Undo/Redo

```
1. Add a box
2. Move it around
3. Press Ctrl+Z → box returns
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+Z → movement redone
```

### Test Multi-Select

```
1. Add box, sphere, cylinder
2. Click box
3. Ctrl+Click sphere → both selected (green)
4. Ctrl+Click cylinder → all three selected
5. Press Delete → all removed
6. Press Ctrl+Z → all restored
```

### Test Axis Locking

```
1. Add a box
2. Press Y → Y button glows green
3. Try to move box → only moves up/down
4. Press X → switches to X-axis
5. Press Esc → unlocks
```

### Test Magnetic Sketch

```
1. Click "2D Sketch" in toolbar
2. Click 4 points in a square
3. Select "Line Tool"
4. Hover near a point → yellow highlight
5. Click → line snaps and connects
6. Continue connecting points
7. Set depth, click "Create 3D Extrusion"
```

## Key Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action       | Shortcut                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Undo         | `Ctrl+Z`                   |
| Redo         | `Ctrl+Shift+Z` or `Ctrl+Y` |
| Delete       | `Delete` or `Backspace`    |
| Multi-Select | `Ctrl+Click`               |
| Lock X-Axis  | `X`                        |
| Lock Y-Axis  | `Y`                        |
| Lock Z-Axis  | `Z`                        |
| Unlock Axis  | `Esc`                      |

## UI Changes

### Header (New)

```
[↶ Undo] [↷ Redo] | [X] [Y] [Z] | [☑ Show Grid] | Objects: X | Selected: X
```

### Toolbar (Updated)

- Added "🎯 Face Select" toggle button
- "Edit" section now shows count: "Edit (X)" when multi-selecting

---

## Files Modified

### Core Application

- `src/App.jsx` - Complete rewrite with multi-select, undo/redo, axis locking
- `src/App.css` - Added styles for new header controls

### Components

- `src/components/Toolbar.jsx` - Multi-select support, face selection toggle
- `src/components/CADCanvas.jsx` - Pass new props to scene
- `src/components/Scene.jsx` - Multi-select detection with Ctrl+Click
- `src/components/CADObject.jsx` - Axis locking for transforms
- `src/components/PropertiesPanel.jsx` - Multi-select count display
- `src/components/ImprovedSketchModal.jsx` - Fixed lint errors, uses useCallback

### New Files

- `src/utils/historyManager.js` - Undo/redo state management class

---

## Technical Highlights

### History Manager

```javascript
const historyManager = useRef(new HistoryManager());
historyManager.current.push(objects); // Save state
historyManager.current.undo(); // Go back
historyManager.current.redo(); // Go forward
```

### Multi-Select Detection

```javascript
const selectObject = (id, isMultiSelect = false) => {
  if (isMultiSelect) {
    // Toggle in array
  } else {
    // Replace selection
  }
};
```

### Axis Locking

```javascript
<TransformControls
  mode={transformMode}
  showX={axisLock === "x" || !axisLock}
  showY={axisLock === "y" || !axisLock}
  showZ={axisLock === "z" || !axisLock}
/>
```

### Magnetic Snapping

```javascript
const findNearestPoint = (x, y) => {
  for (let point of points) {
    const distance = Math.sqrt(
      Math.pow(point.x - x, 2) + Math.pow(point.y - y, 2)
    );
    if (distance < 15) {
      // 15 pixel snap distance
      return point;
    }
  }
  return null;
};
```

## What's Working

✅ Undo/Redo with keyboard and UI buttons  
✅ Multi-select with Ctrl+Click  
✅ Axis-locked transforms with X/Y/Z keys  
✅ Magnetic point snapping in sketch (15px)  
✅ Line tool with auto-connect  
✅ Delete key for removing objects  
✅ Visual feedback for all operations  
✅ No lint errors, clean build

---

## What's Prepared (But Not Yet Active)

🔧 Face extrusion (utilities ready, needs UI wiring)  
🔧 Boolean operations (CSG library installed, needs UI)  
🔧 Rectangle/Circle tools in sketch (buttons exist, need implementation)  
🔧 Batch transforms (multi-select transforms one object at a time currently)

---

## Server Running

The development server is running at: **http://localhost:5173/**

All features are live and ready to test!

---

## Next Steps (If Needed)

1. **Face Extrusion**: Wire up the face selector to extrude selected faces
2. **Boolean Operations**: Add UI buttons for union/subtract/intersect
3. **Batch Transform**: Make transforms apply to all selected objects simultaneously
4. **Rectangle/Circle Tools**: Implement in sketch modal
5. **Snap to Grid**: Optional grid snapping for precise placement
