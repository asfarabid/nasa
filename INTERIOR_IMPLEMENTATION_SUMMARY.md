## 🧮 Technical Highlights

### Advanced Math Implementation

#### **Cylindrical Coordinate System**

```javascript
// 3D Position → Polar Coordinates
const angle = Math.atan2(z, x);
const radius = Math.sqrt(x² + z²);

// Polar → 2D Unwrapped
const arcLength = angle * radius;
```

#### **Annular Sector Area**

```javascript
// Room area in curved space
area = 0.5 * angleSpan * (radiusOuter² - radiusInner²);
```

#### **Collision Detection**

- Radial bounds checking
- Angular overlap detection
- Height level comparison
- Handles 0°/360° wraparound

### Validation Engine

- **Multi-level validation:**

  1. Individual room requirements
  2. Total space adequacy
  3. Adjacency rules
  4. Safety requirements
  5. Noise zoning
  6. Deck structure

- **Dynamic scoring:**
  - Space efficiency: 30 points
  - Requirements met: 40 points
  - Layout optimization: 30 points
  - Bonuses for excellence

### Data Architecture

```javascript
// Hierarchical structure
Interior Config
  ├─ Habitat specs (radius, length, volume)
  ├─ Decks []
  │   ├─ Level info (floor height, ceiling)
  │   ├─ Rooms []
  │   │   ├─ Type, name, dimensions
  │   │   ├─ Bounds (angleStart/End, radiusInner/Outer, heights)
  │   │   ├─ Area, volume, occupancy
  │   │   └─ Validation status
  │   └─ Corridors [] (Phase 2)
  └─ Validation results
```

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why Completely Separate from Exterior?

1. **Independent Development** - Can work on both simultaneously
2. **No Code Conflicts** - Different problem domains
3. **Easy Testing** - Test in isolation
4. **Modular Architecture** - Can replace or upgrade either system
5. **Clear Responsibilities** - Exterior = shell, Interior = rooms

### Why Two 2D View Modes?

1. **Polar View** - Better for humans (intuitive, visual)
2. **Unwrapped View** - Better for engineers (measurements, CAD export)
3. **Different Use Cases** - Layout vs technical work

### Why Canvas Instead of SVG?

1. **Performance** - Better for real-time rendering
2. **Flexibility** - Easier custom shapes
3. **Animation** - Smoother hover effects
4. **Scaling** - Handles many rooms better

## 📊 By the Numbers

- **23 files created** (docs, data, utils, components)
- **~3,500 lines of code** (excluding docs)
- **13 room types** with full specifications
- **40+ validation rules** (NASA standards)
- **2 coordinate systems** (polar, unwrapped)
- **3 view modes** (2D polar, 2D unwrapped, 3D stub)
- **100-point scoring system**
- **0 dependencies** on exterior CAD system
