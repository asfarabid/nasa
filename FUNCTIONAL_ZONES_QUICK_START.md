# 🎯 Functional Zones - Quick Start Guide

## What are Functional Zones?

Functional zones are **3D volumes** that define different areas in your habitat (sleeping, lab, gym, etc.). They are:

- ✨ Transparent and colorful
- 🎯 Drag-and-drop to place
- 🔄 Adaptive to container shapes
- 🚫 Collision-aware (won't overlap)
- 🎨 Fully customizable

## 5-Minute Tutorial

### Step 1: Switch to Interior Mode

From the main app, click the **"Interior Design"** tab or button.

### Step 2: Find a Zone Type

Look at the **Zone Palette** on the left side. You'll see zones like:

- 🛏️ Sleeping Zone
- 🔬 Lab Zone
- 💪 Gym Zone
- 🚿 Hygiene Zone
- And more!

### Step 3: Drag & Drop

1. Click and hold a zone card
2. Drag it into the 3D viewport (center)
3. Drop it where you want it

**The zone will automatically:**

- Fit inside your habitat shape
- Avoid overlapping other zones
- Show you a colorful transparent volume

### Step 4: Move & Adjust

- **Click** a zone to select it
- **Drag** it to move around
- Use the **Properties Panel** (right side) to:
  - Change position precisely
  - Adjust size (width, height, depth)
  - Change transparency
  - Lock or hide zones

### Step 5: Manage Your Zones

In the Properties Panel:

- 🔒 **Lock button**: Prevents accidental movement
- 👁️ **Visibility button**: Show/hide zones
- 🗑️ **Delete button**: Remove zones

## Zone Categories

### Essential (Red Priority)

- Sleeping, Hygiene, Medical, Kitchen, Command
- Required for crew survival and operations

### Important (Orange Priority)

- Lab, Exercise, Dining
- Needed for mission success and crew health

### Optional (Blue Priority)

- Recreation, Storage
- Nice to have for crew morale

## Tips & Tricks

### 🎯 Placement Tips

- Drop zones on container surfaces for automatic positioning
- Use the grid as a reference for alignment
- Zones snap to container boundaries automatically

### 📏 Sizing Tips

- Each zone has a **minimum volume requirement**
- The system warns you if a zone is too small
- Zones auto-scale to fit containers when possible

### 🎨 Visual Tips

- Adjust opacity to see through overlapping zones
- Different colors help identify zone types quickly
- Edges are highlighted for better visibility

### 🚀 Performance Tips

- Start with essential zones first
- Lock zones you don't want to accidentally move
- Hide zones temporarily to reduce visual clutter

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Cylindrical Habitat

1. Drop sleeping zones along the outer wall
2. Place central corridor for circulation
3. Add lab and work zones in between
4. Zones automatically curve to fit the cylinder

### Scenario 2: Multi-Module Station

1. Dedicate entire modules to specific functions
2. Use one module for sleeping quarters
3. Another for labs and workstations
4. Connect with corridor zones

### Scenario 3: Compact Habitat

1. Use minimum-sized zones to save space
2. Stack zones vertically (different heights)
3. Prioritize essential zones only
4. Maximize volume efficiency

## Keyboard & Mouse

### Mouse Controls

- **Left Click**: Select zone
- **Click + Drag**: Move zone
- **Right Click + Drag**: Rotate camera
- **Scroll Wheel**: Zoom in/out

### Orbit Controls

- **Pan**: Right-click + drag
- **Rotate**: Left-click + drag (on empty space)
- **Zoom**: Scroll wheel

## Understanding the UI

### Left Panel: Zone Palette

- **Search bar**: Find zones by name
- **Filter buttons**: Essential, Important, Optional
- **Zone cards**: Drag these into viewport

### Center: 3D Viewport

- **Main work area**: See your habitat and zones
- **Drop target**: Drop zones here
- **Interactive**: Click and drag zones

### Right Panel: Properties

- **Zone info**: Name, icon, description
- **Controls**: Position, size, opacity
- **Actions**: Lock, hide, delete

## Troubleshooting

### "Zone won't fit in container"

→ Try making the zone smaller or the container larger

### "Zones keep overlapping"

→ The system auto-resolves this - wait a moment after placing

### "Can't see my zone"

→ Check if it's hidden (eye icon) or too transparent

### "Zone disappeared after dropping"

→ It might be inside the container - rotate camera to find it

## Next Steps

Once you've placed your zones:

1. ✅ Verify all essential zones are present
2. ✅ Check that minimum volumes are met
3. ✅ Ensure no overlaps or collisions
4. ✅ Fine-tune positions for optimal layout
5. ✅ Lock zones when satisfied with placement
