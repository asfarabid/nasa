# Essential Features Implementation Guide

## üéâ Newly Implemented Features

Your CAD system now includes all the essential features you requested! Here's what's been added:

---

## 1. ‚úÖ Undo/Redo System

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Undo**: `Ctrl+Z` (or `Cmd+Z` on Mac)
- **Redo**: `Ctrl+Shift+Z` or `Ctrl+Y` (or `Cmd+Shift+Z`/`Cmd+Y` on Mac)

### UI Buttons

- Located in the top header bar
- Undo button: **‚Ü∂ Undo**
- Redo button: **‚Ü∑ Redo**
- Buttons are disabled when no actions are available
- Hover over buttons to see keyboard shortcuts

### How It Works

- Automatically saves state after every modification
- Maintains up to 50 states in history
- Tracks all object additions, deletions, transformations, and property changes

### Example Usage

1. Add a box
2. Move it around
3. Press `Ctrl+Z` ‚Üí box returns to previous position
4. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Z` ‚Üí redo the movement

---

## 2. ‚úÖ Multi-Select

### How to Multi-Select

- **Single select**: Click on any object
- **Multi-select**: Hold `Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on Mac) and click additional objects
- **Toggle**: `Ctrl+Click` on a selected object to deselect it

### Visual Feedback

- Selected objects shown in green color
- Header shows: "Selected: X" where X is the number of selected objects
- Toolbar "Edit" section shows count: "Edit (X)"

### Multi-Select Operations

- **Delete**: Press `Delete` or `Backspace` ‚Üí removes all selected objects
- **Duplicate**: Click Duplicate button ‚Üí creates copies of all selected objects
- **Transform**: Currently transforms the last selected object (batch transforms coming soon)

### Example Usage

1. Click first box ‚Üí selected (green)
2. `Ctrl+Click` sphere ‚Üí both selected
3. `Ctrl+Click` cylinder ‚Üí all three selected
4. Press `Delete` ‚Üí all three deleted
5. Press `Ctrl+Z` ‚Üí all three restored

---

## 3. ‚úÖ Axis-Locked Transforms (Constrained Movement)

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Lock to X-axis**: Press `X`
- **Lock to Y-axis**: Press `Y`
- **Lock to Z-axis**: Press `Z`
- **Unlock**: Press `Esc` or press the active axis key again

### UI Buttons

Located in header between Undo/Redo and Grid toggle:

- **X** button ‚Üí lock to X-axis (horizontal)
- **Y** button ‚Üí lock to Y-axis (vertical)
- **Z** button ‚Üí lock to Z-axis (depth)
- Active button glows green with shadow effect

### How It Works

When an axis is locked:

- Transform gizmo only shows handles for that axis
- Object can only move along the locked axis
- Works with translate, rotate, and scale modes

### Example Usage

1. Select a box
2. Press `Y` ‚Üí Y button glows green
3. Try to move the box ‚Üí only moves up/down (Y-axis)
4. Press `X` ‚Üí switches to X-axis lock
5. Press `Esc` ‚Üí unlocks all axes

- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Yellow highlight when hovering near a point
  - Yellow circle shows snap radius
  - Cursor snaps to nearest point automatically

### Auto-Connect Feature

- **Bevel Size**: Slider when bevel enabled (0.01 to 1)

### Example Usage

1. Click "2D Sketch" in toolbar
2. Click Point Tool (active by default)
3. Add 4 points in a square pattern
4. Switch to Line Tool
5. Click first point ‚Üí yellow highlight
6. Click second point ‚Üí line created and snaps
7. Continue connecting points
8. Set extrude depth to 2
9. Click "Create 3D Extrusion"
10. Your 2D sketch becomes a 3D object!

- **Alternative**: Press `Backspace` key

### Works With

- Single selected object
- Multiple selected objects (multi-select)
- Won't trigger when typing in input fields

### Combined with Multi-Select

1. `Ctrl+Click` to select multiple objects
2. Press `Delete` ‚Üí all selected objects removed
3. Press `Ctrl+Z` ‚Üí all restored

---

## 6. ‚úÖ Face Selection Mode (Prepared)

### How to Activate

- Click "üéØ Face Select" button in toolbar
- Button glows when active
- Click again to deactivate

### Future Enhancement

- When active, clicking object faces will highlight them
- Selected face can be extruded
- Face extrusion feature prepared and ready for integration

## UI Layout Overview

- Orbit camera (click+drag to rotate)
- Transform gizmos when object selected
- ViewCube in bottom-right corner

## Pro Tips

### Workflow for Complex Models

1. **Rough layout**: Add shapes quickly
2. **Multi-select similar objects**: `Ctrl+Click` to group
3. **Axis-lock for alignment**: Use `X`/`Y`/`Z` to move in straight lines
4. **Undo liberally**: `Ctrl+Z` lets you experiment freely
5. **Duplicate for patterns**: Select, duplicate, move with axis lock

### Sketching Best Practices

1. **Start with Point Tool**: Layout your shape's vertices
2. **Switch to Line Tool**: Connect points precisely
3. **Use magnetic snapping**: Get within 15 pixels, it snaps automatically
4. **Close your shapes**: Connect last point to first
5. **Extrude conservatively**: Start with shallow depth, can always adjust

### Transform Efficiently

- `Y` lock ‚Üí perfect for moving objects up/down (gravity direction)
- `X` and `Z` locks ‚Üí move along ground plane
- Use orbit camera to change perspective before locking axes

## Technical Details

### History Manager

- **Class**: `HistoryManager` in `/src/utils/historyManager.js`
- **Capacity**: 50 states
- **Storage**: JSON serialization for deep cloning
- **Methods**: `push()`, `undo()`, `redo()`, `canUndo()`, `canRedo()`

### Multi-Select State

- **State**: `selectedObjectIds` array in `App.jsx`
- **Detection**: Event handler checks `e.ctrlKey` or `e.metaKey`
- **Visual**: Objects in array get green highlight color

### Axis Locking

- **State**: `axisLock` string ('x', 'y', 'z', or null)
- **Implementation**: TransformControls props `showX`, `showY`, `showZ`
- **Toggle**: Keyboard or UI buttons

### Magnetic Snapping

- **Algorithm**: Euclidean distance calculation
- **Threshold**: 15-pixel radius
- **Function**: `findNearestPoint(x, y)` in sketch modal
- **Callback**: Uses React `useCallback` for optimization

---

## What's Next?

### Coming Soon

- **Batch Transform**: Move/rotate/scale multiple objects simultaneously
- **Face Extrusion**: Full implementation with face selection
- **Boolean Operations**: Union, subtract, intersect for selected objects
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys for precise movement
- **Snap to Grid**: Optional grid snapping for transforms
- **Material Multi-Edit**: Change material for all selected objects

### Known Limitations

- Multi-select transform applies to last selected object only
- Face selection mode prepared but extrusion not yet wired
- History doesn't track view/camera changes
- Sketch modal doesn't support rectangle/circle tools yet (buttons prepared)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Undo/Redo Not Working

- Make sure you're not typing in an input field
- Check if buttons are disabled (no history available)
- Try clicking on canvas first to ensure focus

### Multi-Select Not Working

- Ensure you're holding `Ctrl` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd` (Mac)
- Click directly on object geometry, not empty space
- Check header shows "Selected: X" count

### Axis Lock Stuck

- Press `Esc` to unlock
- Click the glowing axis button again to toggle off
- Refresh page if keyboard state is stuck

### Magnetic Snap Too Sensitive/Not Working

- Snap distance is 15 pixels (hardcoded)
- Look for yellow highlight when hovering
- Ensure you're using Point or Line tool (not other modes)

---

## Conclusion

You now have a fully functional CAD system with:

- ‚úÖ Professional undo/redo
- ‚úÖ Multi-object selection and editing
- ‚úÖ Axis-constrained transforms
- ‚úÖ Intelligent magnetic point snapping
- ‚úÖ Keyboard shortcuts for efficiency

The system is modular and ready for continued expansion. Happy modeling! üèóÔ∏è
